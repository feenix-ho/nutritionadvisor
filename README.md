## Rule-Based Expert System

All nutrition logic is implemented in [`src/utils/nutritionRules.ts`](src/utils/nutritionRules.ts) as a set of clear, maintainable rules. The NutritionAdvisor inference engine applies forward chaining to generate advice based on user answers.

## Customization

- Add new rules or modify existing ones in `nutritionRules.ts`
- Update UI components for new features or branding
- Integrate a backend for user history or advanced analytics (optional)
